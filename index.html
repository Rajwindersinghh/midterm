      <h2>Life of a Starfish</h2>
      <p><img src="images/starfish.jpg" alt="Starfish Image">Starfish begin life as little larvae that float openly in the water. As they grow older, they also move to the ocean floor where their bodies can be seen to have radial symmetry. Starfish, unique to most animals, have five arms that spread from a centralized disk, providing it a beautiful star-like appearance. The capacity of starfish to grow more arms is one wonderful quality. Starfish are great masters of regeneration because they are capable of creating a new arm if one is lost due to harm or attack. They are able to live and grow despite serious injuries because of this unusual adaptation. Starfish are efficient predators as well. They are able to capture and control their target due to the specific tube feet they have on the inside of their arms. Their strong arms and tube feet can be used to break apart shells, particularly those of clams and mussels. The starfish splits up its shell and pushes its stomach into its prey, where it physically digests it. These fascinating creatures are attractive because they come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and vibrant colors. Starfish have an amazing range of shapes, from little species with beautiful patterns to big ones with spiky bodies. Starfish are efficient predators as well.
